WORKING


    //Uploading Data:
    Upload Data from CSV To Backend in batches
    Once received in backend it will create table in mysql for that csv and add data in it
    
    //Getting Data:
    Now the backend will response with data in MySQL in batches like 1000 at a time and as we scroll the next batches would be added as per requirement

    //Handling Data:(updating)
    Once the data is received data, another datastructure stores it and any changes in the data or updates will be done on this datastucuture
    All changes will be stored in a queue ( for sequentially updating data on mysql ) 

    //Save
    After saving, the changes would be applied to database in sequence using queue
    autoSaving will be present to save after some time
